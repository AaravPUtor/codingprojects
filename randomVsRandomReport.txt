RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?
Although both Player one and two seem to have probabilities of winning close of 0.5 each, in every run of
OthelloControllerRandomVSRandom, Player two has a higher probability of winning compared to player 1. There may be some
advantage for player 2, although it doesn't seem clear without further investigation or proof.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:
The video discusses how statistics can be analysed both in a programmatically implemented or mathematical solution,
providing simplified methods of proving statistical hypotheses. The talk discusses how various methods of analysing
hypotheses, such as bootstrap resampling, which is the analysis of randomly sampled set including duplicates of an
initial sample set, alongside shuffling which analyses the mean if results of one hypothesis are shuffled with the
alternate. All these methods are also shown as implementations in python using the random library, where random
indexes from a sample set are processed in different ways to obtain new conclusions. The other two methods include
direct simulation, which is the repeated simulation of an event to record the trend or frequency of a particular
outcome to support or disprove a hypothesis, and the last method is cross validation. But the premise of the video
isto show how all these complex processes can be represented simply using for loops and simple programmed arithmetic,
and discusses how this method helps us understand the question or hypothesis that is being asked much better than with
calculations.

4) H0 is: There is no advantage for either player in a game between two players from PlayerRandom.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Ha is: There is an advantage for one player in a game between two players from PlayerRandom.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results support Ha, so they do not support H0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0

OthelloControllerRandomVsRandom performs a direct simulation of 10,000 different othello games between two Random
Players, recorded the game winners and totalled the frequencies of P1 and P2 winning. Then it calculated the probability
of either player winning by dividing the total wins of a player by 10,000 (total games played). The results are:
Probability P1 wins=0.4566
Probability P2 wins=0.4991
These results indicate that P1 won 4566 times and P2 won 4991 times out of 10000 games, with the remainder being neither
winning, or a tied-game. To do a test considering only two possible outcomes, we will only calculate probabilities based
on games that are not tied. Since tied results do hold relevance to the probability of either player winning, we will
ignore any games that are tied and will calculate total games and their corresponding probabilities using only the games
where one of the players won:

Hence, our adjusted total trials are: 4566 + 4991 = 9557 games played
Using this our adjusted probability for each player winning is (P1 = Player 1 Random, P2 = Player 2 Random:
Probability P1 Winning = 4566/9557 = 0.4778
Probability P2 Winning = 4991/9557 = 0.5222

Using these probabilities, we can setup a Binomial Test to investigate the p-value and signifance of the results, here
the values used in the binomial test are:

n = number of games played(adjusted) = 9557
k = number of games won by Player 2 = 4991
p = 0.5, which is the probability of success under the null hypothesis H0

However, since our n value is very large (since np > 5 and nq > 5 because (np = nq = 4778.5)),
we can perform a normal approximation:

Under the null hypothesis, which is H0, our probability of success (P2 winning) must be 0.5. Hence p = 0.5,
we know that our n value is 9557. So we can calculate our expected mean and standard deviation

expected mean = 9557 * 0.5 = 4778.5
(expected standard deviation)^2 = 9557*0.5*(1-0.5) = 2389.25   ---> square root both sides to get s.d.
expected standard deviation is therefore approximately 48.88

As established, we are performing normal approximation, so let us get the z-score for our corresponding mean and standard
deviation values:

z = (k - expected mean)/(expected standard deviation) = (4991 - 4778.5)/48.88 = 4.347, approximately 4.35

Using this z-score of 4.35, we have to find the corresponding p-value on the normal distribution table,
this corresponds to 0.000013614, since it is a two-tailed hypothesis we doubled our p-value (Calculated using symbolab's
p-value calculator, the link for which is below:
https://www.symbolab.com/calculator/statistics/p-value?calculator=p-value&target=0&have=0&z_score=4.35

This value represents the probability that P2 wins 4778.5 times exactly, or probability of H0 being true.
However, this probability value is well below the significance threshold of p = 0.05 as our p-value is 0.000013614.
Hence, we have to reject H0 with a high degree of confidence. Indicating that Player 2 must have an advantage over
Player 1, thus Ha holds, and one player has an advantage over the other even though both use the Random strategy.

CONCLUSION:
H0 is rejected, and Ha must be true
