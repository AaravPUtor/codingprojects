This repository contains programs I designed for industry-specific use cases and were inspired by the training provided at my past internships and high-school/university courses
I have programs written in python, C and java in this repository, and it will continue to grow as I attempt more substantial projects in various languages
There are some simple use cases part of this repository, but as a programmer entering their second year of university, I enjoy learning more about programming languages through these small tasks!
